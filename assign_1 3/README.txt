Group 2 - Assignment 1



Android app for entering the patient details and showing the random data generated when the RUN button is clicked.

The app used the GraphView provided for the assignment and does not use any other third party components.

Functionality:
When the run button is clicked, Update thread is started and the thread updates the view by passing random generated values to the view.

The thread sleeps for 1000 milliseconds and then updates the view in regular intervals untill the stop button is clicked.

When the stop button is clicked we terminate the loop of the thread by modifying the signal variable.
