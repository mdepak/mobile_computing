Group 2 - Assignment 2


Android app for entering the patient details, creating database and table for all patients to store the data generated by the accelerometer sensor and also to show them on the UI. It can also upload and download the database.

The app uses GraphView library and Sensor service provided for the assignment.

Functionality:
When the run button is clicked, Service is started and it updates the view by passing the data generated by the accelerometer to the view and it also creates table using the values entered in the form.

Then the service updates the view in regular intervals and each of these values are inserted in the database until the stop button is clicked.

When the stop button is clicked we terminate the service by passing an intent.

When upload is clicked, the application uploads the database that is created to the server.

When download is clicked, the asyntask downloads the database of the group to the device and displays the last 10 values of the patient whose details are entered in the form.
